                Ok, I think that’s everything... Looped down into the sewers,
                handled everything before Gascoigne, and cleared out all the
                Huntsman’s Minions in the back alleys. Central Yharnam should be
                completely empty.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s my sixth venture into New Game+, the final time the game
                increases its difficulty. Bloodborne is already a challenging
                game, and the difficulty has <i>been ramping up each time</i>  I’ve
                chosen to complete it. Of course, I could have merely stopped
                near the end of the first or second run, capping the difficulty
                there and doing what I needed to then, but where was the sport
                in that? The game still had challenges to offer, and how could I
                turn that down?
              </p>
              <p>
                This run is specifically dedicated to learning the ins-and-outs
                of the Threaded Cane <strong>Trick Weapon</strong>, technically one of the
                “Starter Option” weapons available, but as with all the Trick
                Weapons in Bloodborne.
              </p>
              <h2>Looped down into the sewers</h2>
              <p>None are really better than the rest, so
                “starter weapon” or not, it’s just a matter of preference and
                play-style. That being said, I longingly look at my +10 Ludwig’s
                Holy Greatsword in my inventory, my favorite and primary weapon
                in previous runs. It turns out that, while I like to think the
                grace and finesse of using a sword-cane that transforms into a
                serrated whip would be more my style, in reality, smashing
                things with a giant greatsword felt much more rewarding to me.
